### QUICK-START
1. 	Install an Apache 2.4 PHP server and MySQL (e.g. WAMP).

2. 	Launch your server and go onto http://127.0.0.1/ in your 
	web browser (localhost) or provided registrar domain name.

3. 	Drag the SimplePost installation onto the servers 
	appropriate project directory.

4.a Create a database using your phpMyAdmin.

4.b Make sure apache is setup to override 
	with RewriteCond. (Advanced)

4.c Edit .htaccess files and change the directory of auto_prepend 
	to root directory.

5. 	Go to config.php in the root directory.

6. 	Fill in the servername, database to use and the database root 
	username and password.

7. 	Open your website and follow the onscreen instructions.

### GLOBAL FUNCTIONS
- getPosts(start_offset, amount, sort_by_type)
	How to use: This function returns an array of posts. Each entry 
	in the array contains an array that represents all the post info
	such as post title, post image, and so on. 'start_offset'
	decides where in the database to begin and 'amount' sets how
	many posts should be in the returned array. 'sort_by_type' is
	a string value to sort by, for example 'date' will sort the
	array by post dates automatically.
- getSinglePost(post_id)
	How to use: Get an array of post information. 'post_id' is the posts PK
	(primary key) uniquely identifying the post in the database.
	Useful for linking when combined with getPosts() since it 
	contains these id's.


### TROUBLESHOOTING
- ERROR: CR_SERVER_GONE_ERROR "MySQL server has gone away"
  FIX: The max allowed packets for the database is too low. Go into the MySQL
  directory and locate the configuration file (my.ini in Windows) and set
  max_allowed_packet = 128M.

- ERROR: Warning: Unknown: failed to open stream: No such file or directory in Unknown on line 0
  FIX: Check the htaccess-file and change the auto_prepend_file real path to root directory.
